            <ul>Getting an interview call for your dream job is another step in the right direction. However, it is not the end of the road as you still need to crack that interview.

In this blog, we look at some important interview skills that can help you ace the interview and get the job. So, let us see what are the most effective interview skills!
</ul><br/><br/>
<ul type="circle"><h2><u>Research the company </u> &nbsp; üîç</h2>
<br/>
This is not an option! It is extremely important to gain basic information about the company for which you are interviewing. In a study, 47% of interviewers revealed that they wouldn‚Äôt offer the job to a candidate if they had little knowledge of the company.
</ul>

<ul>Look up for important information about the company - vision and mission, key personnel, and recent milestones. You should also read up the latest news about the specific department or vertical for which you are interviewing.</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul><h2><u> Analyze job description </u> &nbsp; üí≠</h2>
<br/>
Along with researching the company?, be sure to note the key focus areas of the role you applied for. Read carefully the job description, and make a list of the points to justify how you are capable of achieving these specific duties.
</ul>

<ul>In case you have past experience, mention briefly critical instances where you have contributed. Be eager and enthusiastic but not desperate.</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul> <h2><u>Brush up basics </u> &nbsp; üß†</h2>
<br/>
Along with an impressive personality, you also need excellent subject knowledge. Whether you are a fresher or an experienced professional, you can expect certain tough questions. Brush up your subject fundamentals if you are a fresher. In case you have work experience, organize your thoughts about your work and present them well.
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul><h2><u>Prepare for tests </u> &nbsp; üìÉ</h2>
<br/>
Do prepare for any written tests, activities, and/or presentations that may be mentioned in the job posting. This way, there will be no surprises during the interview and you will be mentally prepared for it.
</ul>
<ul><br/><br/>
<h2><u> Prepare for potential interview questions </u> &nbsp; ‚ùî</h2>
<br/>
Most of the interviews have many common questions. Some of the examples of such common questions are - 'tell me about yourself', 'describe who you are', 'why should I hire you', 'why do you want this job', 'where do you see yourself in five years', etc. Make a list of such potential questions related to the job profile, background, company, etc. and prepare for them in advance.

<br/><br/>
<ul> <h2><u>Be punctual </u> &nbsp; ‚è∞</h2>
<br/>
Reach well in time to appear professional. People who arrive late are often rejected even before they appear for the interview. Plan your method and route of travel in advance. Also, keep a time buffer in case of heavy traffic or some other reason. This way you can reach on time without being stressed.
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul> <h2> <u>Be attentive </u> &nbsp; ‚ö†</h2>
<br/>
Good communication skills can go a long way in impressing the interviewer. Listen carefully to everything the interviewer is saying. This is not the time to daydream or be distracted. Match their pace of talking to better connect with them while also making sure you heard what was said.
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul> <h2><u>Speak clearly </u> &nbsp; üó£</h2>
<br/>
Maintain clarity of speech at all times to project confidence and clarity of thought. When communicating, speak in a calm and clear manner. Don‚Äôt be in a rush to get all the answers out. Avoid mumbling as it makes you look nervous and unsure. If you do not know the answer, be honest about it.
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<ul> <h2><u>Maintain good body language </u> &nbsp; üë®‚Äçüéì</h2>
<br/>
A lot of communication is indeed non-verbal. And this is critical in an interview. In fact, 33% of employers figure out within the first 90 seconds of an interview whether they will hire someone.
</ul>

<ul>Slouching in your seat, sitting in a laidback position or being fidgety can go against you. Instead, sit upright and keep a smile on your face.</ul>

<ul><h2> <u>Make eye contact </u> &nbsp; üëÅ</h2>
<br/>
When you talk to an interviewer, be sure to look at them. Don‚Äôt look down or at the wall or the clock. This shows a lack of confidence. Communicate with the interviewer by making eye contact. This displays confidence while allowing you to make an engaged connection.
</ul>

<ul>Remember, the interview is all about you and how well you represent yourself. So be confident and follow the above tips. We are sure you will be able to do a good job!</ul>
